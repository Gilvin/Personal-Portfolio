                    <p>
                        Ever since I was a kid, I have always been drawn to playing games. It has brought me through the toughest times of my life and given be the biggest smiles. 
                        Gaming has connected me with so many amazing people that I still talk to today.
                        I wanted to create stories that people can get not only get immersed in, but learn from.
                        There's nothing like getting pulled into a game, and I've always felt using that pull to tell a story with a long-term thematic idea at it's core would make games better.

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I am currently a first year computer science student at Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario. 
                    I found a passion for computer science when I discovered how creative it allowed me 
                    to be while also learning valuable life skills such as problem solving. 
                    With computers and technology becoming the future, I want to be a part of building something that impacts peoples day to day life. </p>
                <p>I enjoy being able to freely create and express myself in different ways. 
                    Photography, graphic design, and video creations allow me to do so while also being engaged with technology and computers. 
                    In my free time I enjoy going outside and using inspiration to take photos through my own creative personal lens. 
                    Graphic design and video creations are also hobbies of mine as I can independently create using skills learned in computer science. 
                    When I am not creating, I enjoy watching and playing sports to stay social and active.</p>
